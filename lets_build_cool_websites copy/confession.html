    <p>My name is Walter Hartwell White. </p>
    <p>I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. </p>
    <p>This is my confession.</p> 
    <p>If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader.</p>  
    <p>Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. </p>
    <p>Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. </p>
    <p>He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. </p>
    <p>Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. </p>
    <p>I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. </p>
    <p>I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. </p>
    <p>I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. </p>
    <p>Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. </p>
    <p>I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. </p>
    <p>Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. </p>
    <p>I didn't know where to turn. </p>
    <p>Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. </p>
    <p>From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. </p>
    <p>Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000.</p> 
    <p>Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so.</p> 
    <p>In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. </p>
    <p>I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. </p>        
    <p>I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. </p>
    <p>Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me.</p> 
    <p>For 3 months he kept them. </p>
    <p>My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children.</p> 
    <p>We were scared. </p>
    <p>I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. </p>
    <p>Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. </p>
    <p>I can't take this anymore.</p> 
    <p>I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. </p>
    <p>I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.</p>
